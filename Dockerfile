# Build environment for the kernel packages. Not the OS being shipped -- a
# hermetic box with pacman, base-devel and the kernel's build dependencies.
#
# It is an Arch Linux ARM rootfs rather than a stock archlinux image or a
# third-party archlinuxarm mirror, for one reason: the packages built here are
# installed on Arch Linux ARM, so the glibc and toolchain that build them should
# be the ones that will run them. A gcc/glibc skew between builder and target is
# the sort of thing that produces a module that loads everywhere except the
# device you care about.
#
# We are already on aarch64 (native GitHub ARM runner, or your machine), so this
# builds natively -- no qemu-user, no binfmt.

 # The tarball is a full bootable system, so it drags in a kernel and the whole
 # linux-firmware family -- around 1.3 GB a build container can never use,
 # because it never boots:
 #     /usr/lib/firmware  ~980M
 #     /boot              ~197M   (linux-aarch64)
 #     /usr/lib/modules   ~188M
 #
 # This MUST happen in the fetch stage. A `pacman -Rns` in the builder stage
 # would only add another layer -- the COPY --from below would still carry every
 # byte and the image would not shrink at all.
 #
 # Nothing depends on them: linux-aarch64 is only optional-for base, and
 # linux-firmware only optional-for linux-aarch64. Dropping the matching
 # /var/lib/pacman/local entries keeps the package database coherent.
